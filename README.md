# Chemistry-Integrated Discord Bot

Developed during high school, this project represents the intersection of my passions for Software Development and Chemical Science. Recognizing Discord as a primary hub for student collaboration, I built this bot to provide seamless access to high-fidelity chemical data. By integrating the PubChem API, the bot allows users to retrieve accurate molecular properties and data points instantly within a chat interface, bridging the gap between social connectivity and academic research.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Data Pipeline
This project leverages a robust Python-based stack to bridge the gap between raw chemical databases and user-friendly Discord interfaces.

Core Language
- Python: The primary engine for bot logic, asynchronous API handling, and data processing.

Data Manipulation & Analysis
- Pandas: Utilized for structuring complex JSON responses from the PubChem API into manageable DataFrames, ensuring high-speed data parsing and filtering.

Data Visualization
- Matplotlib: Used for generating static chemical property plots and distribution charts.

- Seaborn: Employed to create high-level, aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations of chemical trends (e.g., electronegativity vs. atomic radius) directly within Discord.
